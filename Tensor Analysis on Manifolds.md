&#8712; : element of

&#8713; : not an element of

x &#8712; A : x belongs to A; x &#8713; B : x does not belong to B

A set is specified by placing all it's elements or a typical element and the condition which defines "typical" with braces, \{\}. In the latter case we separate the typical element from the condition by a vertical |.

A &#8834; B : set A is a "subset" of B
B &#8835; A : set B is a "superset" of A

x &#8834; x is always true
x &#8712; x is usually true

A=B same as A &#8834; B 

A &#8745; B is the intersection of A with B
A &#8746; B is the union of A and B
